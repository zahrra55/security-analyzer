# Code Security Analyzer

Code Security Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze code files for potential vulnerabilities. It offers both a **web-based interface** and a **command-line interface (CLI)**, making it accessible for developers with different workflows. The project leverages a **pre-trained machine learning model** to detect vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations for fixing them. Additionally, it generates detailed security reports in PDF format.

## How It Works

### Pre-trained Model

The project uses a **pre-trained machine learning model** based on the `CodeBERTa` architecture. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset of secure and insecure code snippets, annotated with vulnerability types. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The uploaded or provided code file is tokenized and preprocessed into a format suitable for the model.
   
2. **Vulnerability Detection**:
   - The model analyzes the code for patterns associated with vulnerabilities.
   - It assigns a probability score to each detected issue.

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Based on the detected vulnerabilities, the system generates recommendations for fixing the issues.

#### Model Details:
- **Architecture**: CodeBERTa (based on RoBERTa).
- **Training Dataset**: A curated dataset of 50,000+ secure and insecure code snippets.
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers (PyTorch).
- **Limitations**:
  - The model is not perfect and may produce false positives or miss certain vulnerabilities.
  - It works best with common programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C, Java, and PHP.

### Capabilities and Limitations

#### What the Project Can Do:
- Detect common vulnerabilities in code files.
- Provide recommendations for fixing detected issues.
- Support both web and CLI modes for flexibility.
- Analyze multiple programming languages.
- Generate PDF reports summarizing the analysis.

#### What the Project Cannot Do:
- Detect highly complex or obscure vulnerabilities.
- Guarantee 100% accuracy in analysis.
- Replace manual code reviews by security experts.
